Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my website! It's here to give a brief intro to who I am professionally, and of course to show that **I can make things with code**.

## who i am

I'm a **full-stack software engineer** living in Portland, Oregon. My family and I love it here, and my dream career in tech is one where I get to learn and grow in this community as part of an intimate and highly collaborative team.

My biggest strengths are **adaptability** and **willingness to explore** new things. I've yet to find a stack I can't make myself useful in, and quickly.

## what i'm good at

- **frontend web development** (and I **actually like CSS**. Really.)
- **backend development**, designing APIs and evolving them as needed
- writing **SQL** (I've been using it for about 10 years, since college)
- **scripting and automation** (I even sometimes write JavaScript on my phone??)
- **clear, honest communication**

### languages and technologies

- **TypeScript / JavaScript / Node**
- **React**
- CSS (both vanilla and with Tailwind)
- **Scala**
- Python
- SQL (mostly PostgreSQL)
- GraphQL
- AWS

## where i've worked

My last software job was at small fintech startup, [Flow Finance](https://flowfi.com/), where I was the only cold hire on the engineering team and was **quickly marked for promotion from junior to mid within 6 months**.

### Flow Finance

**Software Engineer, Backend** \* _Jul 2022 - Jan 2023_

My main task was to build and maintain an API for initiating and **managing customer OAuth** integrations. We built SAM applications in Scala, leveraging AWS Lambda, AppSync, API Gateway (and more) to expose both **REST and GraphQL APIs** to internal applications.

**Junior Software Engineer, Frontend** \* _Jul 2021 - Jul 2022_

I Developed major features for **internal and costomer-facing web apps** with **Typescript, React**, and Redux. Working closely with our product and design teams, I used **CSS and Tailwind** to create beautiful UI and thoughtful UX.

### University of Redlands and Walla Walla University

In my pre-coding days, I worked in higher education at various tech-adjacent admin roles, both for [Walla Walla University](https://wallawalla.edu/) and [University of Redlands](https://redlands.edu/). I **wrote SQL and managed BI systems**, tuition AR/AP, and departmental **IS/IT support and maintenance**. I also briefly served as an interim Director of **Institutional Research** at WWU.

## what i've studied

### full-stack web development

I graduated from [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) (an intense 1000+ hour **coding bootcamp** with a < 4% acceptance rate) after attending from November 2020 to April 2021.

### business administration & finance

- I have my **MBA (Finance concentration)** from [University of Redlands](https://redlands.edu/) where I attended from 2018 to 2019.
- Before that, I went to [Walla Walla University](https://wallawalla.edu/) from 2011 to 2015 where I got my **BBA** (Bachelor of Business Administration, also with a Finance concentration).
