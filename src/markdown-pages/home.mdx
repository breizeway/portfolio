Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my website! It's here to give a brief intro to who I am professionally and to show that I can actually build websites. If that's why you're here, read on!

### who i am

I'm a full-stack software engineer in Portland, Oregon. Portland is my home and my idea of a great career

then I'd love to work with a team of people who are as passionate as I am about writing code and solving problems.

### what i'm good at

JavaScript, TypeScript, Scala

### what i've done

Mostly I've worked on web sites, web apps, and APIs and middleware that power them.

From July 2021 - Jan 2023, I worked at Flow Finance

### what i've studied

- I graduated from [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) (a rigorous 1000+ hour full-stack web dev bootcamp with a < 4% acceptance rate) in April 2021
- Got my MBA from the University of Redlands in 2019 and my BBA from Walla Walla University in 2015, both with concentrations in Finance
