### My portfolio site
<p><Link to='/about'>live site</Link> | <a href='https://github.com/breizeway/portfolio'>GitHub</a></p>

This site. The way I structured it is actually pretty cool. I used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) along with React, GraphQL, and Markdown. The framework is Gatsby, it's built with React, and each page is a Markdown file fetched with a GraphQL query. I wanted the site to be primarily text based--I love Markdown, so what better way to build it so it is simple to understand and update moving forward?
