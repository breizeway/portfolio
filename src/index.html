          <br />
          <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to my website! It's here to give a brief intro to who I am
            professionally, and of course to show
            <strong>I can make things with code</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>who i am</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> living in
            Portland, Oregon. My family and I love it here, and my dream career
            in tech is one where I get to learn and grow in this community as
            part of an intimate and highly collaborative team. My biggest
            strengths are <strong>adaptability</strong> and
            <strong>willingness to explore</strong> new things. I've yet to find
            a stack I can't make myself useful in, and quickly.
          </p>

          <h2>what i'm good at</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>frontend web development</strong> (and I **actually like
              CSS**. Really.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>backend development</strong>, designing APIs and evolving
              them intelligently in a sympathetic and non-breaking way
            </li>
            <li>
              writing <strong>SQL</strong> (I've been using it for about 10
              years, since college)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>scripting and automation</strong> (I sometimes write
              JavaScript on my phone??)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>clear, honest communication</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>languages and technologies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>TypeScript / JavaScript / Node</strong></li>
            <li>
              <strong>React</strong>
            </li>
            <li>CSS (both vanilla and with Tailwind)</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scala</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>SQL (mostly PostgreSQL)</li>
            <li>GraphQL</li>
            <li>AWS</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>where i've worked</h2>
          <p>
            My last software job was at small fintech startup,
            <a href="https://flowfi.com/">Flow Finance</a>, where I was the only
            cold hire on the engineering team and was
            <strong
              >quickly marked for promotion from junior to mid within 6
              months</strong
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Flow Finance</h3>
          <span>
            <h4>Software Engineer, Backend</h4>
            Jul 2022 - Jan 2023
          </span>
          <p>
            My primary responsibility was to build and maintain an API for
            initiating and
            <strong>managing customer OAuth</strong> integrations. We built SAM
            applications in Scala, leveraging AWS Lambda, AppSync, API Gateway
            (and more) to expose both <strong>REST and GraphQL APIs</strong> to
            internal applications.
          </p>
          <span>
            <h4>Junior Software Engineer, Frontend</h4>
            Jul 2021 - Jul 2022
          </span>
          <p>
            I Developed major features for
            <strong>internal and costomer-facing web apps</strong> with
            <strong>Typescript, React</strong>, and Redux. Working closely with
            our product and design teams, I used
            <strong>CSS and Tailwind</strong> to create beautiful UI and
            thoughtful UX.

          <h3>University of Redlands and Walla Walla University</h3>
          <p>
            In my pre-coding days, I worked in higher education at various

            <a href="https://redlands.edu/">University of Redlands</a>. I
            <strong>wrote SQL and managed BI systems</strong>, tuition AR/AP,
            and departmental <strong>IS/IT support and maintenance</strong>. I
            also briefly served as an interim Director of
            <strong>Institutional Research</strong> at WWU.
