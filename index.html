          <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to my website! Come learn more about me and how
            <strong>I make cool things with code</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>who i am</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> in Portland,
            Oregon. I have a diverse background which includes coding bootcamp,
            financial service at non-profits, and getting my MBA.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm into <strong>difficult puzzles and good design</strong>. I'm not
            concerned with a specific tech stack, but rather motivated by
            working with <strong>passionate and uplifting people</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm open to
            <strong>both full-time and contract</strong> opportunities right
            now. <a href="#know-more">Talk to me</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>what i'm good at</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>frontend web development</strong> (I absolutely love
              TypeScript and building pixel-perfect CSS)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>backend development</strong> (I'm experienced in designing
              semantic and intuitive APIs, especially in serverless
              environments)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>writing SQL</strong> (for nearly 10 years now, since I
              taught myself as a student worker in college)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>scripting and automation</strong> (in my free time I like
              to write automations on my phone in javascript or with iOS
              shortcuts)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>analytical thinking</strong>, but also
              <strong>empathetic, clear communication</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>languages and technologies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>TypeScript, JavaScript, Node</strong> (anything JavaScript
              adjacent)
            </li>
            <li><strong>React</strong>, Next.js, Redux</li>
            <li><strong>Tailwind, Material UI</strong></li>
            <li>
              semantic <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> (either plain old CSS or
              whatever system you're using)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scala, Python</strong></li>
            <li>
              <strong>SQL</strong> (mostly PostgreSQL) and noSQL systems like
              DynamoDB
            </li>
            <li><strong>GraphQL</strong>, Apollo, URQL, RESTful APIs</li>
            <li>
              <strong>AWS</strong> (S3, Lambda, AppSync, CloudFormation, SQS,
              SNS, etc)
            </li>
          </ul>
