# My Personal Site

The live site is at [tannor.net](https://tannor.net), but
[tannorbreitigam.com](http://tannorbreitigam.com) works too.

## About

This is a pure, static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, hosted with github pages. No packages, no libraries, no surprises. I originally built it with Gatsby when that was the new hotness, but they ended their hosting service in 2023 and I decided to use the opportunity to distill it down to just the basics. It's super fast now, and I love developing with it. Check it out!
