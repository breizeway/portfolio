# My Portfolio Site

The live site is at [tannor.net](https://tannor.net), but
[tannorbreitigam.com](https://tannorbreitigam.com) works too.

## About

I originally built this site fresh out of App Academy and thought it would be cool to write each page on the site with markdown. I think that idea make much less sense now, but I'm not quite ready to rewrite the whole thing, so here in 2023 I've just given it a quick simplification and rewritten all the copy.

## Technologies Used

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as an option for a lightweight and performant react sites
- a touch of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to query the file
- hosted with Gatsby Cloud.

## Dev Instructions

To set the project up:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open the development site in your browser at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

### Deployment

Builds are automated with Gatsby Cloud, which checks pull requests to ensure a successful build. Merged pull requests to `main` to deploy to prod.
